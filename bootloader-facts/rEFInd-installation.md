## Getting rEFInd
If you'r in Linux you can use [terminal-installation](#goto2)(recommended) or even install it manually from [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/refind/files/)(downlaod latest zip file). If you'r in windows, you have to install refind packages and some other softwares manually. Install rEFInd from [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/refind/files/)(downlaod latest zip file) and EasyUEFI from [here](https://getintopc.com.pk/softwares/utilities/easyuefi-technician-free-download/).

## <a name="goto1">Preparation</a>
Before moving forward we first need to do some minor preparation for both Windows and Linux users who want to install rEFInd manually. After downlading rEFInd package, Extract it to your Desktop and rename it to "refind", open it, edit `refind.conf` and add the following text at the end of the file.
```
menuentry "Darkmatter" {
    volume 
    loader /kernel
    initrd /initrd.img
    options "root=/dev/ram0 androidboot.hardware=android_x86_64 androidboot.selinux=permissive SRC=/"
}
```
Edit the location of required files if you have installed your OS in any other custom location.

## Windows Installation
If you done downloading all required packages for windows, we're good-to-go for further steps.
